Offline Rails Guides
====================

The [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cts=1331682020502&ved=0CC8QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fguides.rubyonrails.org%2F&ei=1tpfT9COEsPe0gHvxvTBBw&usg=AFQjCNHHaSh5-eD3g_dnbniu7aCsGQ0g2g&sig2=TY-Tnpz6uHQsL5gFaIHVGA) are a great resource, but have you ever wanted or needed an offline copy? If so, this is the place to be.

I was wondering if the guides were available for offline viewing and found out they [were](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5752617/rails-guides-offline-documentation).

The guides available were generated using Rails v3.2.2.
